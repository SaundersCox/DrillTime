*It’s Drilltime! Create and share marching routines with other marchers, drum majors, band directors, and drill sergeants.*

## For Band Directors

- Easily save your entire drill composition as plaintext to send to all of your students and fellow instructors.
- No installation necessary! Just load the website and get designing.
- No loading bulky software or renewing licenses.
- During rehearsal breaks, your students can review the drill to stay on top of the day’s goals.

## For Students

- Quickly load the drill into the drill editor to reference a set you’re learning.
- DrillTime makes it easy to study your drill on your own; you know where everyone else is, even if they’re not there with you.
- Textbooks are increasingly going digital. Your drill charts should too!

## Easy to Use

The intuitive design allows for easily draggable performers to make designs however the creator envisions it.
